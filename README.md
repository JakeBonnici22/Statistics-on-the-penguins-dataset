Introduction to the data set palmerpenguins with the aim of
giving insight on the penguins that are recorded at the Palmer Station located in the Palmer
Archipelago on Anvers Island, Antarctica. 

The data is separated in 8 columns; Species, island, bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body
mass, sex and year. There are a total of 3 species; Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo each living
at 3 different islands; Dream, Biscoe and Torgersen. The penguins are categorised firstly by
sex, and their anatomical features are then categorised by their; bill length and depth and their
flipper length, all measured in mm. The respective body mass of each penguin is recorded.
Each row includes the year the data was attained, which includes 2007, 2008 and 2009. The
following report aims to show some correlations between the different species and sex of the
penguins with respect to their anatomy differences, etc.
